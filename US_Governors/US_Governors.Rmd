## OVERVIEW

This markup introduces you to my EDA project on all the governors of the United Sates of America. 
Working with this data set will give me insight on which governor served the shortest term or which political affiliation is dominating. More importantly, it will also help to develop my skills.

<br/>

## THE DATA

I obtained this data set from `Kaggle.com` and is part of a competition. It has all of the U.S. governors that served or were elected as as governor for each sate. Territories or certain states of the _Thirteen Colonies_ that had the office of _"president"_ are not included.

      - There are 8 columns:
          StateFull
          StateAbbrev
          GovernorNumber
          GovernorNmae
          TookOffice
          LeftOffice
          PartyAffiliation
          PartyAbbrev
      - In CSV format

This data set is owned by Brandon Conrady on _Kaggle_ and it was last updated on May 12, 2021. It is
open to the public and its license is _CC0: Public Domain_. You can view more about the data set and
