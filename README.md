This file introduces you to this EDA project on the governors in the United Sates of America. 
I will work with a data set of all the United States Governors. I am seeking to get insight from 
this data set and to develop my skills.

### The Data

I obtained this data set from `Kaggle.com` and is part of a competition. It has all of the U.S. governors
that served or were elected as governor for each state. Territories or certain states of the _Thirteen Colonies_ that had the office of _"president"_ are not included.

      - There are 8 columns:
          StateFull
          StateAbbrev
          GovernorNumber
          GovernorNmae
          TookOffice
          LeftOffice
          PartyAffiliation
          PartyAbbrev
      - In CSV format

This data set is owned by Brandon Conrady on _Kaggle_ and it was last updated on May 12, 2021. It is
open to the public and its license is _CC0: Public Domain_. You can view more about the data set and
Brandon's work here: _https://www.kaggle.com/brandonconrady_.
